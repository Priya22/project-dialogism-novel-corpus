your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be explained by
such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He had just
parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest
affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.
Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware
that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for
some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by
our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a case,
a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his

"Q673","If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender
recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well
in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of
fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan
from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages
were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows
and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and
my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from
my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable
of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the
attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a
different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me
for ever. She was married married against her inclination to my
brother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.
And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who
was at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he
did not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support
her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the
misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame
all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing but how
blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We
were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The
treachery, or the folly, of my cousin s maid betrayed us. I was
banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no
liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father s point was gained. I

one but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few
months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now
to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard
for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from
the first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind
so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon s, was but too
natural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her
situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those
regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that,
with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to
advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after
their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she
should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps but I meant to promote
the happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that
purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had
given me, was of

The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of\nfancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan\nfrom her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages\nwere nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows\nand friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and\nmy affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from\nmy present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable\nof having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the\nattachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a\ndifferent cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me\nfor ever. She was married married against her inclination to my\nbrother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\nAnd this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who\nwas at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he\ndid not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support\nher under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the\nmisery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame\nall her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing but how\nblindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We\nwere within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The\ntreachery, or the folly, of my cousin s maid betrayed us.

"Q675","Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended, by the resemblance
I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates,
their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet
disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier
marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other
be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you
for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood a subject such as this untouched for
fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all! I _will_ be more
collected more concise. She left to my care her only child, a little
girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about
three years old. She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.
It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have
discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education
myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no
family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. I
saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother,
(which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the
possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. I
called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in
general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It is now
three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I
removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very
respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four
or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I
had every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February,
almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her,
(imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go
to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father
there for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I
thought well of his daughter better than she deserved, for, with a most
obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no
clue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning,
but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no
information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the
girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they
chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced
himself, of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business.
In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest,
for eight long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I
feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.","['Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,', 'by the resemblance\nI have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.

"Q813","What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is
not to be described. While she with the truest affection had been
planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that
he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person! such a
suspicion could never have entered her head! If she suspected _any_
prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_ quarter. said she, She was
quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be
done, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am
sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make
him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose
by my arguments, and Fanny s entreaties, was of no avail. Duty,
affection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so
stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal
designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle
on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good
thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it
twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in
this low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must
attend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be
his all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from

If she suspected _any_\nprepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_ quarter.', 'said she,', 'She was\nquite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be\ndone, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am\nsorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make\nhim put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\nby my arguments, and Fanny s entreaties, was of no avail. Duty,\naffection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so\nstubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal\ndesigns, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle\non him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good\nthousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it\ntwelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in\nthis low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must\nattend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be\nhis all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from\naffording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into\nany profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her\npower to prevent him advancing in it.""']","[[458788, 459192], [459215, 459224], [459261, 460420]]","John Dashwood","['Marianne', 'Mrs. Jennings', 'Elinor']","Anaphoric","he went on","[['poor Mrs. Ferrars', 'Mrs.', 'Ferrars', 'Fanny', 'her', 'she', 'him', 'he', 'her', 'she'], ['she'], ['She', 'We', 'she', 'Edward', 'He', 'Mrs. Ferrars', 'you', 'Fanny', 'Edward', 'His mother', 'him', 'her', 'his', 'him', 'she', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'His', 'she', 'his', 'she', 'him', 'she', 'him', 'he', 'she', 'her', 'him']]","[[[458793, 458810], [458798, 458802], [458803, 458810], [458832, 458837], [458850, 458853], [458885, 458888], [458964, 458967], [458996, 458998], [459099, 459102], [459112, 459115]], [[459220, 459223]], [[459261, 459264], [459288, 459290], [459359, 459362], [459386, 459392], [459394, 459396], [459450, 459462], [459531, 459534], [459573, 459578], [459672, 459678], [459713, 459723], [459737, 459740], [459741, 459744], [459773, 459776], [459804, 459807], [459808, 459811], [459828, 459831], [460012, 460014], [460070, 460073], [460121, 460124], [460149, 460152], [460173, 460176], [460182, 460185], [460202, 460205], [460230, 460233], [460252, 460255], [460289, 460291], [460357, 460360], [460377, 460380], [460398, 460401]]]","[[['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Fanny'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars']], [['Mrs. Ferrars']], [['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars', 'John Dashwood'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Marianne', 'Mrs. Jennings', 'Elinor'], ['Fanny'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars']]]"

could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with

at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my
cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was
afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us
for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in
my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your
brother s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once
Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.
However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then
it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,
and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had
declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but
Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that
as soon as he had went away from his mother s house, he had got upon
his horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he
had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get
the better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he
said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at
all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because
it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds,
and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he
had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they
to live upon that? He could not bear to think of her doing no better,
and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to
the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say
all this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for _her_
sake, and upon _her_ account, that he said a word about being off, and
not upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of
being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing
like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of
talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and
love, you know, and all that Oh, la! one can t repeat such kind of
things you know) she told him directly, she had not the least mind in
the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how
little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all,
you know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and
talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he
should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he
got a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin
called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and
would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into
the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but
she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a
pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.","['Oh, did not you?

brought another short note from Marianne still affectionate, open,

beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a

explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking
solicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other
hand, looking all that was Well, it does not signify; it is over now.
Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not
before I had seen Marianne s sweet face as white as death. _That_ was
the last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in which she
appeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought of her to-day

your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness
has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious
recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was
perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own
behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last
autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of
kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by
myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
time to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I
did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such
feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery, wonder
that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for
atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I
died, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my
friend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my
latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart! How should I
have lived in _your_ remembrance! My mother too! How could you have
consoled her! I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I
looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing
indulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing
kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To
the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common
acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart
hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very
attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them, little as they
deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you above all, above
my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and
its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me? not to any compassion
that could benefit you or myself. Your example was before me; but to
what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I
imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part
in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which
you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew
you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn
away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing
sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had
deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an
unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.","['They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let\nyour kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure.

have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the
time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had
any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance

must have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of
having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any
myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first
twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which
belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered
at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to
do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home
in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my
brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to
be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and
was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part
