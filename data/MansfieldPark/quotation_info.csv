Q1,"My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the
generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a
piece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the
main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of
providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;
and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my
mite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I
look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the
children of my sisters?   and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just   but you
know I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be
frightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and
introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the
means of settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of
ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up
in this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don't say she would be
so handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be
introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable
circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable
establishment. You are thinking of your sons   but do not you know that,
of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought
up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is
morally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the
only sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty
girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,
and I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having
been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and
neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered
boys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this time, and
suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be
more to either than a sister.","[""My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the\ngenerosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a\npiece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the\nmain as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of\nproviding for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;\nand I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my\nmite upon such an occasion.

possible to be mistaken as to a girl's being out or not. A girl not out
has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks
very demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I
assure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,
it is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most
objectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being
introduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass
in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite   to
confidence! _That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does
not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to
every thing   and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the
year before. Mr. Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such

The most\nobjectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being\nintroduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass\nin such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite   to\nconfidence! _That_ is the faulty part of the present system.

every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the

Maria says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with
most of them) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise,
Edmund. As Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only
wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began, for there
was the loss of half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain
will be a good job, however. The maids do their work very well, and I
think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings. There is
no occasion to put them so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I
hope, in preventing waste and making the most of things. There should
always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot
to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day. I had been
looking about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who
should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants' hall-door with
two bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be
sure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father, and then
father had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no
how do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants'
dinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I
hate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have
always said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to
the boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know,
who ought to be ashamed of himself),    _I'll_ take the boards to your
father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.' The boy looked
very silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I
might speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming
marauding about the house for one while. I hate such greediness   so good

horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his
great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on
account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since

quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes

Q966,"It is of
no use, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this
most mortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer
waiting. I will, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my
opinion of your conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I
had formed, and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what
I had supposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have
shewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my
return to England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of
temper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit
which prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which
in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence.
But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you
can and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or
deference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without
even asking their advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different
from anything that I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of
your family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to
have had a moment's share in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_
might be benefited, how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment
for you, is nothing to _you_. You think only of yourself, and because
you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy
imagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him at
once, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a
little more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your
own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from
you such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably,
nobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again. Here is a
young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of
fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most
handsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you
may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by
a man of half Mr. Crawford's estate, or a tenth part of his merits.
Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him. Maria
is nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia's hand, I should
have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than
I gave Maria's to Mr. Rushworth. And I
should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on
receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it
only _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily,
and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any
consultation, put a decided negative on it. I should have been much
surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding. I should have thought it
a gross violation of duty and respect. _You_ are not to be judged by
the same rule. You do not owe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if

power over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and

quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should
come to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to
see how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am
well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in
consequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth
she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is
a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get
married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to
such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an

there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to
answer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and
your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish
Margaret were married, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon the
Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it
was a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all
delighted. She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich,
and she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and
wants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be
as steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does
not seem to know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of
irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In
their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield
Parsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence
in my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes
one feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with
the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as
a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of
perfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was
nothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match
inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to
consider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice
of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having, and
especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world
made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the
young people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of
Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial
comfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a
very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord
Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but
much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I _had_ my doubts
at the time about her being right, for he has not even the air of a
gentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was
dying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to
tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I

her to treat the subject as she did. She was speaking only as she had

unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot

Q1156,"I shall soon have done. I have
told you the substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak,
I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state
of mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to
make me suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in
almost every sentence. That though I had, in the course of our
acquaintance, been often sensible of some difference in our opinions,
on points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to
conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it. That
the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her
brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended
not to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,
giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill
consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance
of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,
recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the
continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as
I now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;
all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never
understood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been
the creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been
too apt to dwell on for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best
for me; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,
hopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now. And yet,
that I must and would confess that, could I have restored her to what
she had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase
of the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of
tenderness and esteem. This is what I said, the purport of it; but, as
you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have
repeated it to you. She was astonished, exceedingly astonished   more
than astonished. I saw her change countenance. She turned extremely
red. I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings: a great, though short
struggle; half a wish of yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but
habit, habit carried it. She would have laughed if she could. It was a
