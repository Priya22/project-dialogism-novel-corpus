with the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,
and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the

I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away
you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the
world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, he
looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they
began whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and
I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do
you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came
quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,
if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I
could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be very
friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no
more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she
was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss
Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to
hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting
away--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards me
too--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and
so he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling
dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and
said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got
three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was
going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's
stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!
dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was
very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went
back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but
I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,
I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,

"Q772","So I begged he would not--for really
as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great
many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept
for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,
so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when
he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say
quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite
distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished
I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,
I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William
Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of
apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down
and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.
William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see
him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it
was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them
all--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did
not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had
sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit
than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their
being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be
able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid
her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for
Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks
were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told
me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley
know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted
to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it
before I was aware.","[""So I begged he would not--for really\nas to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great\nmany left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept\nfor Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,\nso liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same.

honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future

disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had
been accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.

_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of
retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was
not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had
no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite
independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I
really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any
sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every
luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not
necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.","['Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\nperformer!--very far from it, I assure you.

I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to\nme; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future\nhome, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had\nbeen accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\nnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had\nno resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite\nindependent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I\nreally could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any\nsacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every\nluxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not\nnecessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.']","[[494574, 496289]]","Mrs. Elton","['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']","Implicit","nan","[['you', 'your', 'You', 'Miss Woodhouse', 'you', 'Mr. E.', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'him']]","[[[494678, 494681], [494719, 494723], [494936, 494939], [494941, 494955], [494998, 495001], [495346, 495352], [495358, 495360], [495408, 495411], [495555, 495557], [495600, 495602], [496201, 496204]]]","[[['Emma'], ['Emma'], ['Emma'], ['Emma'], ['Emma'], ['Mr. Elton'], ['Mr. Elton'], ['Mr. Elton'], ['Mr. Elton'], ['Mr. Elton'], ['Mr. Elton']]]"
