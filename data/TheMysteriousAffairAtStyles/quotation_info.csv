"Q1708","The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.
Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy
something, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in
consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper
was thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick
document such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in
Mrs. Inglethorp's room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to
destroy some important document   possibly a will. So the discovery of
the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of
course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made
this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell
into a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's
determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the
quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took
place after, and not before the making of the will. Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.
I faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o'clock, Dorcas
overheard her mistress saying angrily: I conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were
addressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five
o'clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the
standpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, At four
o'clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five
o'clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great
shock. Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I
was convinced was correct. The second    scandal' she spoke of was not
the same as the first   and it concerned herself! Let us reconstruct. At four o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her
son, and threatens to denounce him to his wife   who, by the way,
overheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.
Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,
makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.
At five o'clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable
agitation, with a slip of paper      a letter,' Dorcas thinks   in her hand,
and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.
Presumably, then, between four-thirty and five o'clock, something has
occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now
as anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was
that something? As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody
entered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change
of sentiment? One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.
Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she
asked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room
stood her husband's desk   locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,
and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That
one of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in
searching for the stamps she came across something else   that slip of
paper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant
for Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed
that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously
was a written proof of her own husband's infidelity. She demanded it
from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing
to do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought
that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a
very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly
jealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all
costs, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to
pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp's despatch-case, which had been lost
that morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all
important papers in this particular case. Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven
desperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening
she unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room.
Possibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened
quite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the
early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were
accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed
completely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through
Mademoiselle Cynthia's room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.","[""The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why?
