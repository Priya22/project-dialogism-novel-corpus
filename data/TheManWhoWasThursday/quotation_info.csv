head. They learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels; they learn
about anarchists from tradesmen's newspapers; they learn about
anarchists from _Ally Sloper's Half-Holiday_ and the _Sporting Times_.
They never learn about anarchists from anarchists. We have no chance of
denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from
one end of Europe to another. The man who has always heard that we are
walking plagues has never heard our reply. I know that he will not hear
it tonight, though my passion were to rend the roof. For it is deep,
deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble, as
the Christians assembled in the Catacombs. But if, by some incredible
accident, there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus
immensely misunderstood us, I would put this question to him:  When
those Christians met in those Catacombs, what sort of moral reputation
had they in the streets above? What tales were told of their atrocities
by one educated Roman to another? Suppose' (I would say to him),
 suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of
history. Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are
really as harmless as the Christians. Suppose we seem as mad as the
Christians because we are really as meek.","['Comrades,', ""it is not\nnecessary for me to tell you what is my policy, for it is your policy\nalso.

They learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels; they learn\nabout anarchists from tradesmen's newspapers; they learn about\nanarchists from _Ally Sloper's Half-Holiday_ and the _Sporting Times_.\nThey never learn about anarchists from anarchists. We have no chance of\ndenying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from\none end of Europe to another. The man who has always heard that we are\nwalking plagues has never heard our reply. I know that he will not hear\nit tonight, though my passion were to rend the roof. For it is deep,\ndeep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble, as\nthe Christians assembled in the Catacombs. But if, by some incredible\naccident, there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus\nimmensely misunderstood us, I would put this question to him:  When\nthose Christians met in those Catacombs, what sort of moral reputation\nhad they in the streets above? What tales were told of their atrocities\nby one educated Roman to another? Suppose' (I would say to him),\n suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of\nhistory. Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are\nreally as harmless as the Christians.

"Q317","With pleasure, if you don't mind hearing my story, I am by profession an actor, and my name
is Wilks. When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian
and blackguard company. Sometimes I touched the edge of the turf,
sometimes the riff-raff of the arts, and occasionally the political
refugee. In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced to the great
German Nihilist philosopher, Professor de Worms. I did not gather much
about him beyond his appearance, which was very disgusting, and which I
studied carefully. I understood that he had proved that the destructive
principle in the universe was God; hence he insisted on the need for a
furious and incessant energy, rending all things in pieces. Energy, he
said, was the All. He was lame, shortsighted, and partially paralytic.
When I met him I was in a frivolous mood, and I disliked him so much
that I resolved to imitate him. If I had been a draughtsman I would
have drawn a caricature. I was only an actor, I could only act a
caricature. I made myself up into what was meant for a wild
exaggeration of the old Professor's dirty old self. When I went into
the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a roar
of laughter, or (if they were too far gone) with a roar of indignation
at the insult. I cannot describe the surprise I felt when my entrance
was received with a respectful silence, followed (when I had first
opened my lips) with a murmur of admiration. The curse of the perfect
artist had fallen upon me. I had been too subtle, I had been too true.
They thought I really was the great Nihilist Professor. I was a
healthy-minded young man at the time, and I confess that it was a blow.
Before I could fully recover, however, two or three of these admirers
ran up to me radiating indignation, and told me that a public insult
had been put upon me in the next room. I inquired its nature. It seemed
that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous
parody of myself. I had drunk more champagne than was good for me, and
in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through.
